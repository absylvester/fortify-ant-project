# fortify-ant-project
Java project that can be build using an Ant build file

The java project is called EntryToLog.  This project simply allows the user to enter a string in order to guess the password it holds.  Typing the wrong string informs the user that the string is not the password and the application asks for another entry.It also sends a message to the application log telling the user this.  This continues until the entry made is the password saved, at which case the user is informed of this and the application sends a message to the same application log.  The program closes after this.  

The EntryToLog project is comprised of 4 files: the EntryToLog class file (EntryToLog.java), the EntryToLog main class that contains the password (EntryToLogRunner.java), the JUnit test class (EntryToLogTest.java) and the JUnit test runner (TestRunner.java).  The logging library used for this Java project is Log4j (specifically, Log4j 2.13.3).  The Log4j libraries that are pulled from the Maven central repository "repository.sonatype.org" are log4j-api and log4j-core jar files.  The configuration file "log4j2.xml" and the properties file "log4j2.properties", both of which are used to create and format the log file "application.log",are found in the "src/resources" directory and are copied in the "build/classes" directory to be packaged in a jar file (along with the class files and the log4j dependencies).
